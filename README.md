# Individual-Programming-Project
Network Applications Individual Programming P2P Chat System

Project work to build peer to peer chat application, using Java programming language, 
this is purely work of me alone, since it is a Individual-Programming-Project.

In this project there are Two main classes that are required to run on any node to 
become part of the Peer to Peer chat program on any given network. 

Service.java 

This is the class that any node need to connect, and node need to know the IP address of the machine
on which the service is running.
